# Intro-to-Javascript
<h1>What is Javascripts</h1>

Javascript is a programming language used to program web browsers and servers.
Examples include client-side only (no server-side)
Creates interactivity.
Lets you create very rich interactivity.
If if works on a mobile, oits probably javascript .If you want to see what javascript can do, try disabling javascript and watch what happens, a lot of things disappear.
A lot of things might stop working, even the ones that do wont be working the same way.

Fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data tuypes it supports.
These are the values that can be manipulated in a programming language.
Javascript allows you to work with 3 primitive data types.

1. Numbers, e.g. 123, 120.50 etc.
2. Strings of text e.g. "This is a text string"  etc.
3. Boolean e.g. True or False

Javascript also defines two trivial types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value.
Also supports a composite data type known as an object.
Javascript does not make a distinction between integer values and float-point values.
All numbers are represented as floating-point values.
Represnts numbers using 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard.

<h1>Variables</h1>

Can be thought of as named containers.
You can place data inside these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
A variable has to be declared before used.
Declared with the var keyword.
Storing a value in a variable is called initialization.
You  an do variable initialization during creation or when you need to use the variable.
You might ctreate a variable called money and assign the value 2000.50 to it later.
Variables are declared only once.
Javascript is an untyped language, meaning a javascript variable can hold a value of any data type.
There is nmo need to specify the variable type when declaring a javascript variable.
Variable types can be changed.

<h2>Activity 1 daily notes</h2>
 Declaring javascript variables using the var keyword with a semicolon at the edn.
 Variables are like containers you can put data inside of, so each variabl;e hjas to be assigned a value.
 Variables and their values can be put in the same line, e.g ( var myName = "Siya").
Javascript variables have to br written in camelCase.
When javascript values are declared, they have an initiual value of undefined until a value is assigned.
